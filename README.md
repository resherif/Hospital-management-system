## üìò About the Project

This project simulates a simple **Hospital Management System** using **C++**, focusing on core concepts such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data management using classes
- File handling for saving and loading data
- Use of basic STL containers (like `map`, `vector`)

The system includes:
- `Patient` management with automatic ID generation
- `Doctor` records with specializations and time slots
- `Reservation` features for patients to find doctors

## üéØ Why This Repo Exists

This repository was created for the **purpose of studying and practicing programming concepts**. I‚Äôm using it to:

- Understand how real-world systems are structured in code
- Practice C++ file handling and class design
- Learn how to implement design patterns in existing projects
